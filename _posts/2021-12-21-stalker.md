While revisiting 2007's S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl (I'm not going to keep doing the acronym thing) on the YouTube channel, we found that Randy did not enjoy the game nearly as much as I did the first time through. Upon further reflection, I determined that he simply has far inferior taste than I do. Reflecting further still, I must ask why the game bounced off of his tiny, smooth brain while at the same time occupying a permanent space in mine.

Eagle-eyed readers will notice by the title that it's probably because the game is far too janky, and you'd be right! "Jank" in this context meaning glitches, unresponsive gunplay, and generally just questionable design decisions. I won't lie, Stalker is janky as hell. Multiple scripting bugs plagued our playthrough, and quests were left failed or incomplete because of them. Randy was also turned off by the lack of accuracy on all but a very few number of guns in the game. The linear nature of the map, combined with the lack of fast travel in the un-modded game, makes for a ton of arduous backtracking.

Still, I absolutely adore Stalker and I know many others do too, as evidenced by the upcoming Stalker 2 (more on that later) releasing next year. Surely a game with such a cult following has something spectacular to offer if one has to put up with all of that jankiness?

Like I said, I think it does. I believe that Stalker, and when I say Stalker here I mean specifically the first game Shadow of Chernobyl, is one of the most atmospheric games I've ever played. I know that word "atmospheric" gets tossed around a lot as a buzzword, but I really do mean it. When you are crawling around abandoned underground tunnels, flashlight worriedly scurrying around the room searching for that bloodsucker you *know* you just heard, almost nothing else has enveloped my senses and my thoughts so totally.

There's a palpable sense of danger to the game. It's one of the few games that really makes me feel vulnerable, and not just in a "we doubled the enemy health bars and halved yours" sort of way. There's the sense that anything could happen to you at any time, without warning. Sprint too far without checking the path? You might run into a deadly Vortex. Engaged in a firefight with enemy soldiers? Whoops, your gun just jammed. Or you just got eaten by a mutant. Or a random frag just killed you with no warning.

It's events like these that usually go against common game design sensibilities. Usually, the golden rule for game designers is that challenges must be clear and understood by the player, so that overcoming the challenge is entirely within the player's abilities. This is so when the player triumphs (or fails), it feels like the result is completely dependent on their actions. This concept is very important to the majority of gamers. How many times have you heard someone (or yourself) complain about "RNG?" Or exclaim something like, "That's bullshit! How was I supposed to counter that?!"

Stalker revels in denying the player that sort of agency. The Zone is going to kill you, and a lot of the time there is nothing you can do about it. Unlike similarly-brutal games such as Dark Souls (a game I firmly believe I would love if it weren't so punishing) or Getting Over It (a game I am 100% positive I will never love), there is no lesson to be learned here about perseverance. There's almost never something to be learned about the Zone, other than that it killed you. The game is about one step removed from writing "Fuck You" over your dead body at the game-over screen.

There is a silver lining to all of that random bullshittery, though. Because of the relentlessness of the game world, the player's *preperations* actually feel impactful. It's something that other games have tried and, in my opinion, mostly failed at. Take for example, The Witcher series. In the first Witcher game, the player must meditate to craft and consume potions. The intention there is that the player must anticipate their needs *before* entering into battle. They must consider their likely foes and plan accordingly. In The Witcher, however, this was rarely needed, as most battles needed nothing further than a few clicks and spell spams. Higher difficulties may have forced the player's hand into engaging with the system more, but again ran into the "double health bar" problem.

The developers then began rolling back that design ethos in subsequent games. In The Witcher 23, potions are able to be consumed mid-battle, negating the need to plan for a specific situation. Potions are also automatically refilled given a single "refill" crafting material, also letting the player craft potions indiscriminately. This does increase the flow of battle and lets the player be significantly more dynamic, but I can't help but feel the loss of a perfectly-anticipated potion giving me the upper hand in a fight.

Whereas The Witcher eventually shied away from foresight-based challenges in favor of more immediate ones, Stalker has continued to plant itself firmly within that loop of "Anticipate, Prepare, Execute." Of course, sometimes you die to that random frag anyways, but hey, that's life in The Zone, baby!

When I talk about why I love the jank in Stalker, then, I want to make it clear that I mean the unrelenting game design, not the scripting errors and game-breaking bugs. That was why I was mildly concerned with the recent trailer for Stalker 2 (the 4th Stalker game). The game looks gorgeous and the characters seem full of life, but then the trailer cuts to a scene where the player is gunning down a horde of soldiers in the open, tanking bullets like he's Arnold Schwarzenegger in Commando.

My fear with Stalker 2 is that it will walk down the Path of Polish, as I call it. I worry that it will over-sand down the rough edges, leaving us with a game that removes much of Stalker's identity to more broadly appeal to FPS audiences.

I worry because I've seen it before. I'm one of those people that still think Far Cry 2 was the best game in that series. In fact, you could likely Control-F this article for "Stalker" and replace it with "Far Cry" and it would adequately sum up my feelings on that franchise as well. I felt the same way about Far Cry 2 as I did about Stalker: Shadow of Chernobyl. The game made me feel isolated and vulnerable, and preparation and anticipation were the name of the game. Far Cry 3 barreled straight into "one-man army" territory, and suddenly everything I liked about Far Cry was gone. Critics and audiences alike showered the game with praise.

If there's one thing I wish upon Stalker 2, I wish that it retains its identity. Stalker is not just another open-world FPS with geiger counters. It's dangerous, unforgiving, and relentlessly brutal. I guess I just don't want it to turn into another generic theme-park ride power-fantasy FPS. I want the game to spit in my face for daring to walk out into the open with un-repaired armor and 30 bullets. I want to feel small and unimportant. I just hope that isn't too big of an ask. Something tells me I'll likely be disappointed.
