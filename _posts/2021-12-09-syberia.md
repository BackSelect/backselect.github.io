WARNING: Full spoilers for Syberia in this article.

Syberia (2002) is a point-and-click adventure game that has aged like a fine wine.

What I mean to say is, it hasn't. In 2021, the game is held together by shoestrings and bubblegum. The puzzles oscillate between obtuse and impossible. The voice acting, while charming, sounds like it's competing with Resident Evil for whatever the equivalent of a video game Razzie might be. Between all the Comic Sans and questionably-delivered soliloquies, however, is a beautiful game with a lot of heart, something that so often seems to be missing from the meta-hooks and irony-laden writing that permeates much of the gaming landscape today.

Now this isn't one of those posts where I sit down and furiously write at you about how games today are all soulless skinner boxes and any artistry was left at the door circa 2007. I know that's not true; one only has to look at the front page of Game Pass's new releases to see a myriad of heartfelt indies that are more than worth your time.

Indeed, if all Syberia had to offer was heart, then I wouldn't be here right now. I'd probably be writing a post about Sable and Lake. Both of those games, released in 2021, have more than enough heart to fill the chest cavities of 50 Grinches. What then, separates Syberia from the games released in the 19 years since?

I personally believe that more than anything, the reason that Syberia still stands out today is because it feels like a relic of the past. Which past, exactly? Well, all of them. Syberia is, in essence, a celebration of the past in the general sense, using it to drive both a feeling of warm nostalgia and awe-inspiring adventure.

In Syberia, you play as Business Lawyerâ„¢ Kate Walker, point-and-clicking her around all manner of fantastic locations sprinkled around a fake Eastern Europe/Russia. The main plot involves Kate trying to buy out a failing 20th century toy company from its elusive owner Hans Voralberg. Various twists and turns happen as Kate trots around this barren strip of the world, until the ending scene where she decides to throw it all away to save the mammoths with the elderly Hans.

It's pretty nuts when you summarize it like that, but the game isn't exactly subtle with its themes. All throughout the journey, Kate remarks upon the contrast between the quiet, picturesque locales she visits and the uptempo, yuppy New York lifestyle she has departed. Calls from her friends and family in America increasingly alienate Kate from her life as she continues to distance herself from it. Her relationship with her fiance Dan deteriorates before her as he engages in an affair that surprisingly elicits an almost nonexistent reaction from Kate. The increasing importance of the Siberian Mammoth gives the adventure a sense of awe and whimsy.

What all of this leads to is the revelation that the call to adventure is too strong for Kate to ignore, and she throws away the job to heed it. This is obviously a pretty surface-level reading of the game, and its "stop and smell the roses" message isn't exactly new or novel, even for the time, though it is well-executed enough with its painting-like, pre-rendered landscapes and charming characters for that to be forgivable.

It's that parallel theme, that of Syberia's loving devotion to the days of old, that really lets the game stand the test of time. Every location in the game, from the quiet streets of Valadilene to the nearly-abandoned Aralbad Resort, is quite clearly well past its prime by the time Kate steps foot in any of them. What Kate, and by extension the player, come to realize over the course of the journey is that there is a reason why the sparse-but-colorful cast of characters choose to remain stalwart in their dedication to these places.

That reason is wonder. In the language of Syberia, the past is synonymous with a sense of wonder (this is not unique to Syberia, see the [Liminal Spaces Twitter account](https://twitter.com/SpaceLiminalBot)). The further forward in time you go, the less of it you have. Decayed, desolate, and isolated as the locations in the game are, even a fraction of their former glory is enough to completely win over the remaining locals, Kate, and ideally you as the player.

That idea is reinforced by the near constant-references to automaton machinery and wooly mammoths, launching the game world well into the fantastical. The automatons in particular, seem to be made of something akin to magic. Your automaton sidekick Oscar has a mind of his own, serving as the game's primary comic relief. The result of all of these choices ends up as a game that feels almost dreamlike in quality. Not quite an "adventure" in the Indiana Jones sense, but rather the kind of adventure that follows the loosest definition of a logical through-line as you meander about the story.

Now, most everything I've said at this point could have been taken directly out of an article written in 2002. I asked at the top of the article, Syberia is almost 20 years old, why am I still writing about it? Besides of course, the fact that myself and Randy have a complete let's play of it on the Back / Select YouTube channel?

The reason is that by now, Syberia is not only *about* the past, but has rather quickly *become* the past. The game is a relic of a short, but very specific piece of gaming history. It represents this transitional phase where the point-and-click adventure game was on the way out and 3D graphics were on the way in (not that these two things were related, just separate trends occurring at the same time). What we're left with from that time period is a small handful of games that embraced the classic point-and-click formula with 3D graphics, a few years before Telltale reinvigorated the genre with The Walking Dead and The Wolf Among Us, among others. Games like Grim Fandango, The Longest Journey, and of course Syberia occupy this transitional space, rooting the games in that particular moment in time.

As a personal note, I really miss the art style of early 3D graphics. I mean, I don't miss the ugly, polygonal character models, but I have a soft-spot for that era of pre-rendered backdrops. I always think of PS1 Final Fantasy games when I think of that art style. It makes it feel, to me anyway, that you're playing a video game set in a painting. I think the style is absolutely gorgeous and it makes me a bit sad to think of how that technique has more or less lost its relevance in the modern era.

In any case, it's an art style that you don't see much of anymore, especially not in the adventure game scene. Most adventure games nowadays are from a subset of indie studios that almost exclusively work in the pixel-art realm. Not to say they aren't great (check out Primordia from Wormwood Studios and Wadjet Eye!), because they are, but the result of this is that 3D point-and-click adventures almost always scream "dated." I use that term lovingly here, though, because I do truly believe that Syberia is a gorgeous game. Just don't look too closely at Kate's model.

Randy and I played through Syberia on the YouTube channel back in May - it was our first video series, and you can watch the first episode embedded below. What I found while experiencing it again is that the intersection between the datedness of the game's setting and the datedness of the game mechanics created something that truly enveloped me in the past. It felt insular in a way that games don't tend to make me feel anymore. It felt like a little pocket in time, a monument to the late 90s and early 2000s. It felt... cozy, in a way that I think it was supposed to. Could it be, perhaps, that the creators knew what their game would become? It seems impossible, but hey, perhaps there's something magical about the game after all.
